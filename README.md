### Testing User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First time visitor goals

 1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the rules of the game.

            1. Upon entering the site, Users are welcomed with a line of emoji images for visual experience and text that explains the rules of the game.
            2. The User has to press the start button to start the timer and begin the game.

 2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

            1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. Game container stands out from the rest of the page due to the background used.
            2. Buttos are visible due to color contrast used.

 3. As a First time visitor, I want to be able to start the game and reset when needed.

            1. User has time to familiarise himself with the page and rules, the game starts when the user pressse the start button.
            2. The reset button is placed next to the start button which allows the user to reset the game every time the user needs to do so.

- #### Returning visitor goals

 1. As a returning visitor, I want to find all emojis in the quickest time.

            1. User can reveal cards and find emojis behind them. Matched pairs stay revealed and failure to match results in cards being turned back in 1 second time.
            2. User can use different techniques and creativity to reveal cards in the quickest time.

 2. As a returning visitor, I want to  find all emojis with fewer amount of moves.

            1. User can reveal cards and find emojis behind them. Matched pairs stay revealed and failure to match results in cards being turned back in 1 second time.
            2. User can use different techniques and creativity to reveal cards in the least amount of moves. 

 3. As a returning visitor, I want to try different tactics when finding pairs

            1. The way, sequence and turns of revealing cards only depend on users decisions.
            2. The user decides which card to reveal next.

- #### Frequent User Goals

1. As a frequent user, I want to check if the new features have been added.

            1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and game features.

2. As a frequent user, I want to check if the game rules changed

            1. The User would be informed in game rules section of any changes made to the game

3. As a frequent user, I want to beat my records

            1. The User can return to the game and try to solve it in either quicker time or fewer amount of moves.
